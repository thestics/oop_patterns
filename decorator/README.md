## Brief

Python conviniently supports decorator out-of-the-box, so this 
pattern is implemented in a pythonic way

> NOTE: Instead of decorator per operation required, we will use
> parametrized decorators to generalize ops in form of 
> "add prefix" "add suffix"

> NOTE: Task 10.3.2 would look simmilar with funcitons and simple
> corresponding decorators. Omitted intentionally.
